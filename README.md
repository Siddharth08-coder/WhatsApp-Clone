This is an Android App which is clone of WhatsApp and has a basic functionality of the viewing and sending messages to other users.

For data storage and fetching, the app is supported by the server Parse provided by Bitnami and is powered by Amazon AWS EC2 instance. The app allows users to signUp/LogIn and then provides an interface to select user to send message. The user can view the messages from other users and can text them.
